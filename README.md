**agent multiplexer that lives in your terminal.**

workspaces, tabs, panes. mouse-native: click, drag, split. every agent at a glance: blocked, working, done. detach and reattach, agents keep running. no gui app, no electron, no mac-only native wrapper. you see the agent's own terminal, not someone's interpretation of it.

---

## install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://herdr.dev/install.sh | sh
```

or install with homebrew:

```bash
brew install herdr
```

or download the binary from [releases](https://github.com/ogulcancelik/herdr/releases). requires linux or macos.

## quick start

Start Herdr in the directory where the work lives:

```bash
herdr
```

Herdr starts or attaches to one background session server. Press `ctrl+b`, then `shift+n` to create a workspace. Run an agent in the root pane. Press `ctrl+b`, then `v` or `minus` to split panes, `ctrl+b`, then `c` to create a tab, and `ctrl+b`, then `w` to switch workspaces.

Press `ctrl+b q` to detach the client. The server and pane processes keep running. Open another terminal and run `herdr` again to reattach.

## core concepts

**Server and client.** By default, `herdr` attaches to a background server. Detaching closes only the client. `herdr server stop` stops the default server and kills its panes. Named sessions are separate server namespaces: use `herdr session attach work`, `herdr session stop work`, and `herdr session list` when you want fully separate runtime state.

**Workspaces, tabs, panes.** A workspace is the project-level container. Tabs group panes inside a workspace. Panes are real terminal processes, not rewritten agent views.

**Copy.** Herdr copies pane text, not the sidebar. Drag-select inside a pane, double-click a word or token, or press `prefix+[` for keyboard copy mode. In copy mode, move with `h/j/k/l`, `w/b/e`, and `{`/`}`, start selection with `v` or Space, copy with `y` or Enter, and leave with `q` or Esc. In PuTTY and some SSH terminals, hold `Shift` while dragging to use the terminal's own selection, and `Shift` + right click to paste.

**Update and restore.** `herdr update` installs a new binary, but a running server keeps using the old process until it is stopped or handed off. Run `herdr server stop` for the default session, or `herdr session stop <name>` for a named session, then start Herdr again. `herdr update --handoff` is experimental and tries to move live panes, including foreground processes such as dev servers, from the old server to the new one. If `[session] resume_agents_on_restore = true` is enabled and current official integrations are installed, supported agent panes can restart from their native agent sessions after a server restart or update.

**Keybindings.** Herdr uses explicit keybinding strings. `prefix+n` means press the configured prefix, then `n`. `ctrl+alt+n`, `cmd+k`, `alt+1`, and function-key chords are direct terminal-mode shortcuts and do not need the prefix. Plain direct printable keys such as `n` steal normal typing, so use `prefix+n` unless you intentionally want a modifier-gated direct binding.

**Agent awareness.** The sidebar shows blocked, working, done, and idle states. Detection works with process names and terminal output by default. Official integrations make state reporting and native agent session restore more reliable, but Herdr still works as a terminal multiplexer without them.

## update

Herdr notifies you when a new version is available. Run manually:

```bash
herdr update
```

`herdr update` is for installs managed by Herdr's own installer. Homebrew and Nix installs update through `brew upgrade herdr` or your Nix workflow. See [install docs](https://herdr.dev/docs/install/) and [session state docs](https://herdr.dev/docs/session-state/) for the full update, restart, restore, and handoff matrix.

## how it compares

|                          | tmux | gui managers | herdr |
|--------------------------|------|--------------|-------|
| persistent sessions       | ✓    | —            | ✓     |
| detach / reattach        | ✓    | —            | ✓     |
| panes, tabs, workspaces  | ✓    | ✓            | ✓     |
| agent awareness          | —    | ✓            | ✓     |
| lives in your terminal   | ✓    | —            | ✓     |
| real terminal views      | ✓    | —            | ✓     |
| mouse-native            | —    | ✓            | ✓     |
| lightweight binary       | ✓    | —            | ✓     |
| agents can orchestrate   | ?    | ?            | ✓     |

tmux gives you persistence and panes, but it was built before agents existed. gui managers show agent state, but they make you leave your terminal and use their wrapped view. herdr is persistence and awareness in one tool that stays out of your way.

## remote and attach

Herdr works over normal SSH. Run it on the remote host, detach, and reattach later:

```
ssh you@yourserver
herdr
```

You can also attach from your local terminal without opening a shell first:

```bash
herdr --remote workbox
herdr --remote ssh://you@yourserver:2222
```

Direct attach connects your current terminal to one server-owned terminal:

```bash
herdr agent attach <target>
herdr terminal attach <terminal_id>
```

See [persistence and remote docs](https://herdr.dev/docs/persistence-remote/) for remote keybinding, named-session, and handoff details.

## agent awareness

the sidebar shows which agents are blocked, working, or done. workspaces roll up to their most urgent state so you can scan the full list at a glance.

states:

- 🔴 **blocked** — agent needs input or approval
- 🟡 **working** — agent is actively running
- 🔵 **done** — work finished, you have not looked at it yet
- 🟢 **idle** — done and seen

detection works by reading foreground process and terminal output. zero config, no hooks required. for agents that expose hooks, the socket api integration gives more robust state reporting.

## lives in your terminal

not a gui window, not a web dashboard, not electron. herdr runs inside whatever terminal you already use. single rust binary, no dependencies. works inside tmux.

## what you get

- **workspaces** — organized around git repos or folder names, each with its own tabs and panes
- **tabs** — first-class in the socket api and cli
- **copy-friendly** — drag-select pane text, double-click tokens, or use keyboard copy mode with `prefix+[`, `h/j/k/l`, `{`/`}`, `v`, and `y`
- **notifications** — sounds and toasts for background events; tab-aware suppression
- **18 built-in themes** — catppuccin, terminal, tokyo night, gruvbox, one, solarized, kanagawa, rosé pine, vesper, and light variants for the main palettes
- **session persistence** — pane processes survive client detach; sessions restore panes after full restart, with opt-in recent screen history

## agents can use herdr too

The local Unix socket lets agents create workspaces, split panes, spawn helpers, read output, and wait for state changes. Start with the [socket API docs](https://herdr.dev/docs/socket-api/) and [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md).

## supported agents

automatic detection works out of the box. process name matching plus terminal output heuristics.

detected but not fully tested: gemini cli, cline.

for agents outside the built-in list, herdr still works as a terminal multiplexer with workspaces, panes, and tiling. custom integrations can report agent labels over the socket api. see the [socket api docs](https://herdr.dev/docs/socket-api/).

### direct integrations

the built-in pi, omp, claude code, codex, opencode, hermes, and qodercli integrations forward semantic state to herdr over the socket api. install with:

```bash
herdr integration install pi
herdr integration install omp
herdr integration install claude
herdr integration install codex
herdr integration install opencode
herdr integration install hermes
herdr integration install qodercli
```

see the [integrations docs](https://herdr.dev/docs/integrations/) for setup details.

## keybindings

Press `ctrl+b` to enter prefix mode. Default actions are prefix-first and tmux-like:

| key | action |
|-----|--------|
| `prefix+c` | new tab |
| `prefix+n` / `prefix+p` | next / previous tab |
| `prefix+1..9` | switch tab |
| `prefix+w` | workspace navigation |
| `prefix+g` | session navigator |
| `prefix+shift+n` | new workspace |
| `prefix+shift+g` | new worktree |
| `prefix+shift+w` | rename workspace |
| `prefix+shift+d` | close workspace |
| `prefix+h/j/k/l` | focus pane |
| `prefix+v` / `prefix+minus` | split pane |
| `prefix+x` | close pane |
| `prefix+b` | toggle sidebar |
| `prefix+z` | zoom pane |
| `prefix+r` | resize mode |
| `prefix+q` | detach |

Mouse is supported throughout. Resize mode uses `h`/`l` for width, `j`/`k` for height, and `esc` to exit. Full syntax, optional actions, indexed bindings, and custom command bindings live in the [configuration docs](https://herdr.dev/docs/configuration/).

## configuration

config file: `~/.config/herdr/config.toml`

```bash
herdr --default-config   # print full default config
```

In-app settings cover theme, sound, and toast preferences. Herdr writes logs under `~/.config/herdr/`; in persistent session mode, `herdr-client.log` and `herdr-server.log` are usually the useful files. Full configuration and logging details live in the [configuration docs](https://herdr.dev/docs/configuration/).
