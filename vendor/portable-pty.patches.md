# portable-pty local patches

This file tracks intentional local changes applied on top of the vendored
`portable-pty` source. Remove a patch only when the upstream crate contains an
equivalent fix or exposes an option that lets Herdr keep the same behavior.

## 0001 force system ConPTY

status: active

patch: `vendor/patches/portable-pty/0001-force-system-conpty.patch`

herdr issue: https://github.com/ogulcancelik/herdr/issues/761

upstream discussion: none found

upstream pr: none

vendored base: `portable-pty 0.9.0`

local files:

- `vendor/portable-pty/src/win/psuedocon.rs`

reason: `portable-pty` intentionally probes a bare `conpty.dll` after verifying
that `kernel32.dll` exports the ConPTY API. That is useful for WezTerm's bundled
`OpenConsole.exe` and `conpty.dll` pair, but Herdr does not ship that pair and
must not load another application's `conpty.dll` from `PATH`.

remove when: upstream `portable-pty` no longer loads bare `conpty.dll` from the
DLL search path, upstream exposes a way for consumers to force system ConPTY, or
Herdr replaces the Windows PTY backend.

verification:

```sh
python3 -m unittest scripts.test_vendor_portable_pty
```

On Windows, also verify that pane creation succeeds when `PATH` contains a
directory with `conpty.dll`.
